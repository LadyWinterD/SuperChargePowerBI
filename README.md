### The error I found in this book:

* Chapter 17:Creating a Morphing Switch Measure 



{% hint style="info" %}
If you have read this book, you will find out the formula of Measure to Display should be like this:
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
But it is not correct, it is not gonna work, you should change the formula from \[Selected value\] to \[Selected Measure\].
{% endhint %}



```text
Measure to Display = 
SWITCH([Selected Measure],1,[Total Sales],2,[Total Cost],3,[Total Margin $])
```
